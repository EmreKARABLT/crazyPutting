## Crazy putting

***
### Description

The aim of the project is to simulator for putting on sloping greens with obstacles.
The program approximates the physics of real-life putting.

For this project we implemented an artificial intelligence player capable of analyzing
the course and computing how to strike the ball.


### Instruction

- #### Moving around the scene
  - rotate around the scene using mouse (click and drag the frame).
  - zoom-in and zoom-out by using the mouse wheel.
  - You can also navigate around the scene using the keyboard.

- #### Playing the game
  - once game is loaded all the values for the game scene are read from the file _inputFile.txt_.
  
  - on the right panel we placed two boxes to enter the initial velocity of the ball.
  Feel them in with the integer values and press _Hit the ball_ button in order to trigger the ball movement.
  
  - In case the textBoxes were not filled initial velocity will be read from the file _shot.txt_.
  
  - once the ball hits the water it is respawned at the closest position on the grass field.
  
  - click the _Reset ball_ button to bring the ball back to the initial position.
  
- #### Mazes
  - add the obstacles or trees to the game by checking the boxes on the panel
  and right-clicking on the terrain.
  - press _m_ on the keyboard to generate the maze and _c_ to clear all the obstacles from the map.
  - you can specify the difficulty of the maze by pressing number _1-9_ on the keyboard.
- #### Bots
  - choose the bot from the list on the panel and press _bot shot_ button
  to shoot the ball.
